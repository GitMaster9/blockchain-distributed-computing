# Golem Requestor
Golem Network uses Golem images for task execution. You can use public Golem images or build your own by building a Docker image and then converting it into a Golem image using Golem CLI tools (instructions are in the ``build-golem-image`` directory).

This repository offers multiple ways of task execution in their respective subdirectories:
1. Javascript API - golem-sdk
2. Python API - yapapi
3. Ray on Golem API (IN DEVELOPMENT)
